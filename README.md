Program synopses:

Alphabet_Check:

This program takes in a string and finds all the distinct letters in the string. It has methods for returning the string that shows the distinct letters, a count of the number of distinct letters, or whether or not it containsall the letters. It can also display all this information. The main method prompts you to enter a string as the input, though you could also call one of the other methods by itself.


Find_Formula:

This program takes in a sequence of numbers and returns a polynomial formula behind those numbers. The input and output are in the form of float arrays, but there is a method for printing an actual formula, and the main method let you manually enter the input sequence.

The main method has you type in how many numbers you will input next, then you type in the sequence. The first number in the sequence is f(0), the second is f(1), etc.

If you put "1 2 5 10" in the sequence, it will produce x² + 1

If you put "5 7 19 77 241 595" in the sequence, it will produce x⁴ - 2x² + 3x + 5
